To install and compile all the packages to run NaoBridges please follow the next steps:

1. Clone the Thalamus repository (http://hg.code.sf.net/p/thalamus/code) to a folder following this structure: *mainfolder*\Thalamus. The *mainfolder* will contain all the other cloned repositories that will be need.
2. Open the Thalamus project and compile it in the Release version.
3. Clone the EMOTE-Modules-WIP repository in a folder inside the *mainfolder* like it was done for Thalamus
4. Open the EMOTE-Modules-WIP/ExternalTTS project and verify that all the references to thalamus are still valid. In case they are not, please restore them manually, than compile it as Release.
5. Clone the NAOBridges repository in a folder inside the *mainfolder* like it was done for the other repositories.
6. Open the NAOBridges solution and verify that all the libraries references are still valid. In case they're not, please restore them. There is a "libs" folder inside the NAOThalamusSharp project's folder with the libraries that may have lost the reference. If having problem compiling the "NuttyNAO" project, it can be temporary unloaded.

Robot:
1. Copy inside NAO's home folder the three files under NAOBridges/NaoRobot: .bash_profile, install.sh and MonoNAO.tar
2. Execute the install.sh script from the robot command line. This will install mono in the NAO's system. 
3. Create a new folder in home/nao/ called NAOThalamus and copy inside it all the content inside these following folder from the NAOBridges solution:
- \NAOBridges\NAOThalamusSharp\bin\Release\*.*
- \NAOBridges\NAOThalamus\*.*

Execution:
To execute the NAO thalamus and NAO python code it will be needed to execute the following commands on the NAO's command line:
- python NAOThalamus/naoquiXmlrpc.py
- mono NAOThalamus/NAOThalamusMono.exe

Installing Idle behavior
For the system to work properly, the idle.crg behavior needs to be installed into the robot. To do so open the behavior doubleclicking on it. This will open choreograph (https://community.aldebaran-robotics.com/resources/). From Choreograph, upload the behavior to the robot without changing the behavior's name which must be "idle".






================== Thrubleshooting ========================================

- install.sh not working
just execute "tar -xf MonoNAO.tar" from /home/nao/ folder

- can't execute mono even if it is well installed in /home/nao/local/bin 
From any location execute the following command: 
chmod -R +x /home/nao/local/bin
