====================== NAOBridges help ====================

This solution contains 2 main projects, both of them are used to connect a NAO robot to a thalamus character: NAOThalamusSharp and NAOThalamusGUI.

NAOThalamusSharp ---------------------------------------------
Oldest, simpler but more stable version. It's the bridge between the python script running on NAO and the Thalamus network.
It accepts 2 parameters: 
- character name
- NAO's IP

NOTE: using this client requires to manually start the python script in NAO.
